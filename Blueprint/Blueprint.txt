.FirstKey App: Comprehensive Design Blueprint (Version 2.7 - Document Sharing Added)
(Previous sections 1 through 2.1 remain as in Version 2.6)
2.2. Phase 1: Streamlined Expanded Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core Readiness & Email-Based Professional Connections
 * Goal: Validate core value, acquire initial users, and establish a foundational, user-controlled platform for secure connections with multiple MLOs and Realtors via email notification.
 * Key Features:
   * Intuitive User Onboarding & Profile: Friendly questionnaire for initial data.
   * Secure User Accounts with Document Upload Capability: Users must be able to create and log in to a secure account (e.g., email/password, social login). This is foundational for data privacy and connecting. Users will have the ability to upload and store personal documents (e.g., pay stubs, bank statements, tax returns) within their secure account, which can be compiled into a zip file for convenience. Explicit, granular consent for all data handling and professional connections, as detailed in Phase 0.

   * Clear Data Statement: Explicitly states what information from the Homebuyer Progress Indicator will be shared via email with the professional.
   * Document Sharing Option (For Lender Connections Only):
     * If connecting with a Lender, a clear option will appear: "Would you like to share your uploaded documents with this lender?"
     * Two Options for Sharing:
       * Download Option: A button "Download My Documents (Zip File)" allowing the user to download their compiled documents to their device for them to send as they wish.
       * Email to Lender Option (Requires Additional Consent): A checkbox/button "Email My Documents (Zip File) to [Lender's Name]" with an additional, explicit consent statement: "By checking this, you consent to attach your compiled document zip file to the email sent to [Lender's Name]."
   * Optional Message: A small text field for the user to add a quick, personalized message that will be the first message in the email.
   * Final Button: "Send Connection Email" (Accent Green, prominent).
   * Privacy Reassurance: Reiterate, "Only information and documents you've explicitly consented to share will be included in the email sent to the professional."
 * Confirmation of Email Sent: A brief success message (e.g., "Connection email sent! [Professional Name] will contact you directly soon.")
Summary of Changes:
 * Phase 1 - Secure User Accounts: Updated to include the ability for users to "upload and store personal documents... which can be compiled into a zip file."
 * Phase 2 - Secure Document Vault (Clarification): Clarified its purpose as an "Enhanced In-App Sharing" mechanism, distinguishing it from the Phase 1 email/download options.
 * High-Level Technical Architecture: Added "document storage for zip file compilation" to the User Management Service.
 * Section 6 - Connection Confirmation & Data Sharing:
   * Added a new "Document Sharing Option (For Lender Connections Only)" subsection.
   * Introduced two clear choices for the user: "Download My Documents (Zip File)" or "Email My Documents (Zip File) to [Lender's Name]".
   * Ensured that the "Email to Lender" option requires additional, explicit consent from the user, reinforcing transparency and user control.
   * Updated the "Privacy Reassurance" to include documents.
